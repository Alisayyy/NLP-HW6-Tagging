# Module for integerizing Python objects.

# The Integerizer class makes it easy to map between hashable objects and
# integers.  The objects are assigned consecutive integers starting at 0.
#
# For example, it is sometimes helpful to associate each word type in a
# vocabulary with an unique integer.  This integer index can then be
# used to help look up counts or parameters associated with that word
# type.
#
# This is sometimes more convenient than using the word type's string
# representation as a dictionary key, particularly when working with
# libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and OpenFST whose collection objects
# can be indexed only by integer keys.
#
# Integers are tiny to store, fast to compare, and able to index
# lists, vectors, and tensors.  Strings are not.  Therefore, NLP code
# often converts strings to integers upon input, works with integers
# internally, and converts back to strings just before printing
# output.
#
# Integerization is useful not only for strings, but also for feature
# names.  In a log-linear model, a feature should be named by some
# object -- for example, an n-gram feature might be named by an
# n-tuple of strings.  If 7 is the integerized version of that feature
# name, then the feature's weight could be stored at theta[7], where
# theta is the parameter vector in NumPy.

    A collection of distinct object types, such as a vocabulary or a set of parameter names,

    >>> vocab = Integerizer(['','hello','goodbye'])   # lets the empty string '' be 0
    >>> vocab.index('goodbye')                        # convert from word to int
    2
    >>> vocab[2]                                      # convert from int back to word
    'goodbye'
    >>> sentence = ('hello','world','if','world','you','be')
    >>> [vocab.index(w) for w in sentence]            # convert from words to ints (or None if OOV)
    [1, None, None, None, None, None]
    >>> [vocab.index(w, add=True) for w in sentence]  # expand vocabulary on demand (so no OOVs)
    [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
    >>> [vocab[i] for i in [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]]        # convert from ints back to words
